S√∏rhellinga (room to be determined)


Expected previous knowledge, skills and tools: 
Participants are expected to have the R and R studio uploaded and have previous experience working independently and troubleshooting in R. If you need help with installation, please inform Reed and come an hour early to get help with this. 
A brief review of basic concepts and theories behind how spatial data is defined and organized will be covered in the beginning of the workshop but participants should be familiar with and be able to describe examples of the following terms:
‚Ä¢	Geographic information system 
‚Ä¢	Vector and raster representation
‚Ä¢	Attribute data
‚Ä¢	Coordinate systems
‚Ä¢	Georeferencing and Geocoding
‚Ä¢	Image data
‚Ä¢	Remote sensing
‚Ä¢	Models of spatial information (field or object)
‚Ä¢	FAIR data principles

Description
This course is intended to provide a foundation in handling, visualizing, and preparing spatial data for further analysis. Several examples of common spatial analyses (geoprocessing, transformations, interpolation, raster analysis.) will also be covered in the course.

Masters and PhD students as well as researchers who want a refresher or introduction to best practices for working with spatial data will get the most out of this course.
